### Creating A project

## Files within a project

### Adding a file to a project

	fix file add [fileName]

Adds a file to the current folder and project.  If more than one project file exists in the current directory you will be prompted which project you wish to add the file to.

### Removing a file from a project

	fix file remove [fileName]

Removes a file from the current folder and project.  If more than one project file exists in the current directory you will be prompted which project you wish to remove the file from.

### Installing

This is still in very early stages so you'll need to clone the repo, build the source, and then move the files in your bin folder to a location of your choosing.
